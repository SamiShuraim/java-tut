# Week 1 - Day 4 Labs

## Topics Covered
- **If Statements** (14 mins video)

## Lab Instructions

### 1. IfStatementsLab.java
**Objective**: Practice conditional statements and decision making
- Use if, else if, and else statements
- Practice with comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- Combine conditions using logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Understand nested if statements
- Learn about proper code formatting and readability
- Practice with real-world decision-making scenarios

## How to Complete Labs
1. Watch the video for each topic first
2. Open the corresponding lab file
3. Read the objective and instructions carefully
4. Uncomment TODO sections and complete the code
5. Run the programs and test with different inputs
6. Try edge cases and boundary values

## Tips
- Use == for equality comparison, not = (which is assignment)
- For String comparison, use .equals() method, not ==
- Logical operators: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)
- && and || use short-circuit evaluation (stops when result is determined)
- Use proper indentation to make nested if statements readable
- Consider using else if instead of multiple separate if statements when conditions are mutually exclusive
- Think about edge cases and test your conditions thoroughly
