# Week 1 - Day 1 Labs

## Topics Covered
- **Data Types** (20 mins video)

## Lab Instructions

### 1. DataTypesLab.java
**Objective**: Learn and practice Java primitive data types
- Understand the 8 primitive data types (byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean)
- Learn about variable declaration and initialization
- Practice type casting and conversion
- Understand the range and memory usage of each data type
- Work with literals and constants

## How to Complete Labs
1. Watch the video for each topic first
2. Open the corresponding lab file
3. Read the objective and instructions carefully
4. Uncomment TODO sections and complete the code
5. Run the programs and observe the output
6. Experiment with different values and edge cases

## Tips
- Remember that Java is strongly typed - each variable must have a declared type
- Use appropriate data types based on your needs (int for whole numbers, double for decimals)
- Be aware of data type ranges to avoid overflow
- Use 'L' suffix for long literals, 'F' suffix for float literals
- char uses single quotes ('a'), String uses double quotes ("hello")
- boolean can only be true or false (not 0 or 1 like in some languages)
