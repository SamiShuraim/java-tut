# Week 1 - Day 3 Labs

## Topics Covered
- **Arithmetic** (8 mins video)

## Lab Instructions

### 1. ArithmeticLab.java
**Objective**: Practice arithmetic operations and expressions
- Use basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- Understand operator precedence and associativity
- Practice with integer and floating-point arithmetic
- Learn about the modulus operator for finding remainders
- Work with compound assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
- Practice increment and decrement operators (++, --)

## How to Complete Labs
1. Watch the video for each topic first
2. Open the corresponding lab file
3. Read the objective and instructions carefully
4. Uncomment TODO sections and complete the code
5. Run the programs and observe the output
6. Test with different numbers and observe results

## Tips
- Remember operator precedence: parentheses, then *, /, % (left to right), then +, - (left to right)
- Integer division truncates the decimal part (5/2 = 2, not 2.5)
- Use floating-point numbers (double) when you need decimal results
- Modulus (%) is useful for checking if numbers are even/odd or for cycling values
- Be careful with increment/decrement - pre-increment (++i) vs post-increment (i++)
- Avoid division by zero as it will cause a runtime error
