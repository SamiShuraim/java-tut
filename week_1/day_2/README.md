## How to Complete Labs
1. Watch the video for each topic first
2. Open the corresponding lab file
3. Read the objective and instructions carefully
4. Uncomment TODO sections and complete the code
5. Test with different inputs
6. Try the challenge sections for extra practice

## Tips
- Always import java.util.Scanner at the top of your file
- Create Scanner with: Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
- Use nextLine() for strings, nextInt() for integers, nextDouble() for decimals
- Remember to close the scanner with scanner.close() when finished
- Be careful with mixing nextLine() and other next methods (buffer issues)
